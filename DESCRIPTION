Description: Solves ordinary and delay differential equations, where
    the objective funtion is written in either R or C.  Suitable only
    for non-stiff equations, the solver uses a 'Dormand-Prince' method
    that allows interpolation of the solution at any point.  This
    approach is as described by Hairer in <Hairer, Norsett and Wanner
    1993, Solving Ordinary Differential Equations I. Nonstiff
    Problems. 2nd Edition, Springer Verlag>.  Support is also included
    for iterating difference equations.
