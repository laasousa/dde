Title: Solve Delay Differential Equations
Version: 0.0.5
Author: Rich FitzJohn
Maintainer: Rich FitzJohn <rich.fitzjohn@gmail.com>
Description: Solves delay differential equations, where objective
    functions are written in compiled code.  The approach is based off
    of a similar integrator due to Hairer, and uses the Dormand-Prince
    dense output stepper.
