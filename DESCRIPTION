Title: Solve Delay Differential Equations
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Rich FitzJohn
Maintainer: Rich FitzJohn <rich.fitzjohn@gmail.com>
Description: Solves delay differential equations, where objective functions
  are written in compiled code.  The interface is designed to mimic deSolve's
  interface fairly closely.  The approach is based off of a similar integrator
  due to Hairer.
