##' Solve a replicate set of difference (or recurrence) equation by
##' iterating it a number of times.  This is a wrapper around
##' \code{\link{difeq}} that does not (yet) do anything clever to
##' avoid many allocations.
##'
##' It is not currently possible to replicate over a set of parameters
##' at once yet; the same parameter set will be used for all
##' replications.
##'
##' The details of how replication is done here are all considered
##' implementation details and are up for change in the future - in
##' particular if the models are run in turn or simultaneously (and
##' the effect that has on the random number stream).  Logic around
##' naming output may change in future too; note that varying names in
##' the \code{y} here will have some unexpected behaviours.
##'
##' @title Solve difference equations repeatedly
##'
##' @param n Number of replicates.  It is an error to request zero
##'   replicates.
##'
##' @param y The initial state of the system.  Must be either a
##'   numeric vector or a \code{list} of numeric vectors.  If the
##'   latter, it must have length \code{n}.
##'
##' @param ... Additional arguments passed through to
##'   \code{\link{difeq}}.
##'
##' @param as_array Logical, indicating if the output should be
##'   converted into an array.  If \code{TRUE} then \code{res[, , i]}
##'   will contain the \code{i}'th replicate, if \code{FALSE} then
##'   \code{res[[i]]} does instead.  If both \code{as_array} and
##'   \code{restartable} are \code{TRUE}, then the attributes
##'   \code{ptr} and \code{restart_data} will be present as a
##'   \code{list} of restarting information for \code{difeq_continue},
##'   though using these is not yet supported.

  ## It's possible that this could be made slightly more efficient by
  ## shifting the allocations all the way into C but that can be done
  ## later preserving this inteface if that seems necessary.

  ## It's not possible to replicate zero times.  It could be done by
  ## predicting the size of the output and returning an appropriately
  ## sized and named array (with zero in the last dimension) but it
  ## seems weird to me.  For the non-simplified case it's not so bad
  ## because we can just return a zero-length list.
